# R package pasaR
We present an R package, named pasaR, usable in the later stages of an pangenomic
analysis, i.e. after the construction of the gene families for a given set of genomes, based on information of the full complement of gene families. A complete methodology is proposed, suitable for sets of genomes of varying complexity, optimizing and enriching an assortment of existing measures from micropan, the only R package currently available on CRAN for such studies. This is an on-going project so better documentantion, a more extensive vignette and additional functions will be added. However the package is fully functional.

## Install package

If package *devtools* is present, simply run:

```R
library(devtools)
install_github("ampatzia/PasaR")
```
